# 6.047-FinalProject

## Timeline 

# November 29
1. Install LDSC tools for score regression.

Reasonably chill process using https://github.com/bulik/ldsc. There are some useful tutorials there, as well. Our primary interest is in estimating genetic correlation, as per the following: https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Heritability-and-Genetic-Correlation.

2. Download SNP data from the website

# December 2

1. Write scripts to compute LD gene heritability using the aforementioned tools

I'm guessing a bash script will be more appropriate for this, although we'll have to see.

# December 3

1. Write code to implement binary search of a given chromosome.

2. Test code on one chromosome for two selected diseases.

# December 4 -  6

1. Run code on all the combinations to uncover all the regions of interest.

We need a way to verify these regions compared with known regions of interest.
