Interpreting column names as follows:
info:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
snpid:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
a1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
pval:	p-Value
a2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
or:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../6.047-Data/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ../6.047-Data/pgc.cross.BIP11.2013-05.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 1233533 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 133561 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 282630 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 3 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
817339 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (817339 SNPs remain).
Using N = 11810.0
Median value of or was 1.0, which seems sensible.
Removed 39 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (817300 SNPs remain).
